# Hermes
Open-source social network created for gym frequenters.
### About the project
There are a few reasons why I'm developing this project. First and foremost, I feel like it fills a niche.
Social networks such as Strava or Endomondo aren't suited for weightlifting.
On the other hand, training logs don't have social features.
After some field research, my idea was positively appraised.
I prefer to build apps with practical usage, so I decided that I'd give it a shot.

The other main reason: developing this project gives me an opportunity to learn. 
This is certainly a larger scale project than those I've created before.
I have a chance to make something that will be actually used. 
This means that I need to develop it the proper way - everything needs to be top notch: UX, features, deploying changes, etc.
Outside of project management, it enables me to improve my programming skills, of course.

In case you've stumbled upon this repo - feel free to contribute! 
Hermes is my side project and is under active development. 
It's sadly currently missing some useful stuff for contributors: ADRs, API documentation, docs.
For the moment my sole priority is to get Hermes up and running - once it happens, I'll change my priorities and fix this.
